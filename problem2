#Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
#X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
#Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
#You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.


# Use the file name mbox-short.txt as the file name
fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)     #open the file
count = 0                                                 #variable to keep count of number of lines
total = 0                                                 #variable to keep count the floating value
for line in fh:                                           #for loop foriterating the file line by line
    if line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:"):            #condition if any line starts with "X-DSPAM-Confidence:"
        jop = line.find(":")                              #variable for finding the lins which start with "X-DSPAM-Confidence:" and have (:)
        jo = float(line[jop+1:].strip())                  #variable forconverting the string after(:) into float while removing whitespaces from both sides
        total += jo                                       #making the float value stored in total sum up as iteration happend throug each line
        count += 1                                        #making the number of lines iterated increase one by one to reach all required lines
if count > 0:                                             #if number of lines iterated is > 0 then calculate the average
