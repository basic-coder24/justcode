In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/xml3.py. 
The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data,
compute the sum of the numbers in the file.
You are to look through all the <comment> tags and find the <count> values sum the numbers. 





import urllib.request, urllib.error  # Import necessary modules for URL requests and error handling
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET  # Import the xml.etree.ElementTree module for XML parsing

# Prompt the user to input the URL where the XML data is located
url = input("Enter URL: ")

# Try to fetch the content from the provided URL
response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
data = response.read().decode()  # Read the content and decode it into a string

# Parse the XML data into an ElementTree object
tree = ET.fromstring(data)

# Find all 'comment' elements within the XML document
comments = tree.findall('.//comment')

# Extract the 'count' values for each 'comment' element and convert them into integers
# Only include the 'count' values that are not None
count_v = [int(comment.find('count').text) for comment in comments if comment.find('count') is not None]

# Print the total number of 'comment' elements found
print("Count:", len(comments))

# Print the sum of all the 'count' values found in the 'comment' elements
print("sum:", sum(count_v))
